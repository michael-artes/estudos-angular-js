AngularJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular.js)
=========

AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets you
use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.

Oh yeah and it helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and 
deferreds. It also makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a
piece of cake. Best of all?? It makes development fun!
